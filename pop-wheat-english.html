            <li> Wheat is generally taken in winter season, after kharif crop of rice in  assured irrigated areas. </li>
            <li>  In other parts wheat is taken after sorghum, pearl millet, maize, groundnut, Soybean or other legumes (Pulses, beans). Mustard and gram are common intercrops with wheat  in northern plains </li>

        <ul class="ul">
        <li>   Wheat crop requires a well pulverized, but compact seed bed. After Kharif crop  harvesting, land is ploughed and large soil lumps are softened by disc harrow and cultivator.
</li>
        <li> The land should be properly leveled for uniform irrigation. </li>
        <li>  Laser land leveller  should be used for perfect levelled field and saving of orrigation water. </li>

        <ul>
    <li>Seeds are sown 5- 7.5 cm deep, preferably by drilling or behind the plough.</li>
</ul>
Sowing methods:
<span class="brk"></span>
<ol class="ul">
    <li><strong>Broadcasting:</strong>This is a traditional method and generally not recommended. It results in non -uniform plant population and poor yields .In situations where line sowing is not possible braod casting should be done but 25% higher seed rate should be used than recommended </li>
    <li><strong>Sowing in furrows</strong>: After proper seed bed preparation the seed is dropped in furrows behind the country plough by hand (Kerri method). Some times a funnel attached with an iron pipe in the hand of plough (pora/nai) and the seed is dropped at desired depth and spacing(pora Method) .</li>
    <li><strong>Dibbling:</strong> The method was popularized during early sixties and proved under limited seed availability however, being time taking cumbersive and labour intensive it could not be commercialized.</li>
    <li><strong>Drilling:</strong> The sowing is done through seed drills/seed cum fertilizer drill and it has gained popularity. In this way the seedsare dropped at uniform depth and results in uniform germination and regular stand.This method is now most popular and followed in commercial wheat cultivation</li>

     Weeding is very important during early stages. Under irrigated conditions, minimum of three weedings are necessary, first at 20-25 days followed by every 20 day interval.
 </li>
 <li>
   Apply Pendimethalin @ 400 g/Ac at 0-3 days after sowing in 200-240 litres of water/Ac as pre-emergence herbicide 

 </li>
 <li>
     Second weeding  at 40-45 days. Under organic management manual weeding is recommended  since herbicides cannot be used .However for efficient  control of grassy and broad leaved weeds  herbicides are more effective
 </li>
 <li>
      For control of mixed weed population Sulfosulfuron @ 10.0 g/Ac in 100-120 litres of water/Ac can be sprayed at 30-35 days after sowing. 
 </li>
 <li>
      In areas where weeds are not resistant to common herbicides,a  combination of 2,4-D @ 200 g/Ac and isoproturon @ 300 g /Ac can also be used.
 </li>
 <li>
   Third weeding at 60-65 daysif needed can be done manually
